Inital log in to app with spotify connect pressed:
    isConnected = true;
    localStorage full;

Go to profile page:
    isConnected = true;
    localStorage full;
    Top artist not found
    Error: (2x)
        GET https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/top/artists?limit=1 401

        AxiosErrorÂ {message: 'Request failed with status code 401', name: 'AxiosError', code: 'ERR_BAD_REQUEST'
        {\n  \"error\": {\n    \"status\": 401,\n    \"message\": \"Invalid access token\"\n  }\n}

        InfoCard.jsx:56 Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'items')
        at InfoCard.jsx:56:1



Go back to home page:


--- localstorage.getItem(localstoragevalues.accessToekn) -> seemed to work
--- Errors:
    A non-serializable value was detected in the state, in the path: `spotify.topArtist.headers`. Value: 
    AND 'payload.headers' ... idk this 443

    Issues with reducers

    PAYLOAD.HEADERS
        In CONFIG:
        Authorization : "Bearer BQDg1RRoo1_w8QAaXYkyADRFWld5N3ARx_N_CEokh6GQGi7-G4W5_GTkzklQJdrUJssQvwFYesa8VkGGHBW30f614CkagynZpKBP8WOcjrmceLyhWHzjlF_0dkXKiXkr4Kw5gNuV3s_rLc6Vx73JlpuF4tDPEMYytR0UqMD4SqHoe_11DfbKyuCmnjl_CvvFiV1j-LO7"
        Content-Type : null

        Data is populated
        

NEW ISSUE:
    On profile page reload - top artist not found
    Most likely a useEffect issue: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67133211/why-doesnt-useeffect-hook-work-on-page-refresh
